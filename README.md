This is my second HTML/CSS/JS project.

---

Problems:
- This is the second repository for this project as the previous one had a corrupted file. I could't find a working solution for it, so I had to create this repository and copy the files. I lost a few commits.

---

My Thoughts:
- Breaking down this project in steps became easier than previous projects.
- While working through the steps, when I encountered a problem, I didn't try to search for a solution online, instead I tried to break the step down again in more steps, I tried debugging, I console logged everything and I came up with my solution.
- Compared to previous projects, I didn't feel lost anymore. I knew what I was doing and how I want to do it.
- Although my code works, it could perhaps be cleaned. I don't have the knowledge yet on what could be better but I'm making a note to myself to come back and clean the code when I'll learn more about best practices.
